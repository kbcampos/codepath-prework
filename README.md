# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Kaylee Briana Campos**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- Code Path TA's through the Slack groupchat
- Peers in the Slack groupchat
- Peers who have taken IT/Coding Classes

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

While creating a light and sound memory game, I came across a couple of barriers due to lack of familiarity with code. Although this was the case, I did not let it refrain me from performing my best for this assignment. As I was going through the code I was trying my best to be as precise as possible with my code because I had learned in my Information Technology class that code is very sensitive to the point where a single period could affect the whole code. As I was typing in my code, I could see my game developing on the slide next to it. I would make sure to keep in mind everything that I learned in class about code in order to be successful. As far as I knew, the game was running smoothly: sound was playing, colors were changing, there were four squares, and the layout was just as required. It wasn’t until I got to the very end in which I made an attempt to start my game that I came across an issue. At first, it was very frustrating because I had already built the entire game but I couldn’t get it to simply start. I looked over my work multiple times but couldn’t find the issue. As soon as I couldn’t figure out what was wrong, I directed my attention to the internet to look for resources, yet I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with my code. Even though I did find myself to be frustrated because I couldn’t figure out exactly what was wrong, the frustration served as determination. I was determined to get my game to work, so I started seeking help from my peers who have more experience in coding. It was then brought to my attention that my issue was coming from a function that required a single letter to be capitalized. I realized that determination could be both a weakness and strength. It was a strength in the way that it kept pushing me to figure out the issue within my code but it was also a weakness because I was paying attention to the bigger picture instead of the small details. As a person who has a growth mindset, this has taught me that sometimes it might be best to take a break (if permitted) in order to go back with a fresh pair of eyes. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

As I was navigating through the game that I created, it made me think about websites that are created entirely from code. I got to see first hand a sort of website develop as I was creating my game and it made me think about wait time. If there are more and more features added to the website, does it affect web page loading? If so, is there a way that it can be reduced by using code? I think that this was something I was wondering about because as consumers, people often leave sites if it takes longer than a couple seconds to load. If this can be resolved with code, it can be used to the advantage of the producer by tailoring to the consumer’s needs. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If allowed more time to make adjustments to the game I would have loved to learn a lot more about other features that could have been added. As this is one of my early experiences with coding, I was restricted from expanding my current game into something even better and even more engaging to play with. I hope that with more experience and guidance from professionals, I will be able to develop code that can benefit not only me, but those who would use my platform. I would have loved to add a feature in which the buttons also contain pictures along with sounds that resonate with the picture. For example, I would have liked the buttons to be pictures of animals and the sound to be the animal displayed respected noise. I think that by adding pictures and different sounds, it could engage a bigger audience because it requires more interaction. I would have also liked to implement a function that randomizes the pattern so that players are not memorizing the game, defeating the purpose of the game.
